## Neovim configuration

Uses vim-plug to manage plugins.

The structure looks like this:

`init.vim` sources everything in the `init/` folder. You can find configuration for individual items in that folder.

There are also some fun things in other locations.

### Useful plugins

#### Denite.vim

`,en` - Open configuration files
`,er` - Open recent files
`,ir` - Open currently opened files
