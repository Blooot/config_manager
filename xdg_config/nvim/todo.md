# Things to do in Nvim


## Shortcuts I like from PyCharm

```
- <C-Space><C-Space>
    - Complete from anywhere
- <C-J>
    - Complete snippets (Live Templates)
    - Should make the same snippets I have in PyCharm, so that things are easier.
- <C-A-O>
    - Optimize imports
    - Sorts & Optimizes
- <A-Enter>
    - "Fix" something
    - Would be nice to just have a chain of possibilities
    - Import this, spell this, etc.
```
