# Init files

These files contain various configuration information by subject. This way I can leave in ideas about new stuff to try or old ideas, and not end up with a 10,000 line vimrc. It also helps me navigate to things quite quickly.

There are some ideas in the `unite` file about how to navigate to these files quickly using some custom menus.

The sorting ideas are as follow:
    - `00`: Todos / random ideas
    - `01`: General Vim configuration and features/options
    - `02`: Vim plug configuration 
    - `03`: General areas of configuration, that might reach between plugins
    - `04`: Mappings (for non-plugins).
    - `05`: Plugin configuration.
    - `06`: GUI configuration.
    - `10`: Spelling
    - `20`: Ergodox related items
    - `43`: Damian Conway items (D=4, C=3)
    - `99`: lol
