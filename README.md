# config_manager

This is TJ's configuration repo. Feel free to use whatever you would like from it! It'd be great if you mentioned where it came from if you think it's cool.

Major areas include:

## Neovim

Check the `nvim` folder for configuration. For more instruction, see the README there.

Ignore the vim folder, it's out-of-date.
